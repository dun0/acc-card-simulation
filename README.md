1x1 and 4x4 anime card battle sim for finding optimal strategies through mass simulations.


- 50 unique abilities (burns, stuns, revives, counters, stacking mechanics)

- 1v1 & 4x4 modes running 100k+ silent battles

- Team composition win rate tracking & analysis

- Pandas DataFrame export with cumulative win tracking

- Matplotlib/Plotly visualization framework

- Full status effect engine (burn, bleed, stun, dodge, shields)

- Clean OOP architecture with extensible ability mapping

Next:


- Full matchup matrix generation

- Heatmap visualizations

- Performance optimization for million-battle scale

- Maybe expanded card pool (current is ~1/8th of total)

- Bug fixes
